Work Trial Task
Objective: This task is designed to evaluate your ability to work with Next.js, API integration, state management, and documentation using Docusaurus.

Task: Build a Simple Crypto Price Tracker
Description:
Create a Crypto Price Tracker that consists of:

A web dashboard (Next.js) to display live cryptocurrency prices.

A developer documentation page (Docusaurus) explaining your approach.


Task Details:
Web App (Next.js)

Create a simple dashboard that displays the latest prices of 5 cryptocurrencies.

Include:

Project setup guide (how to run both web and mobile apps).

API integration details (how data is fetched and updated).

State management explanation (why you chose React Query/Zustand/Context API).

Challenges & solutions you faced while building the project.



Evaluation Criteria:
API integration skills (fetching, caching, error handling).

UI/UX and responsiveness on both web & mobile.

Code quality and best practices.

State management approach.

Documentation clarity and structure.



Submission Guidelines:
Submit a GitHub repository with:
