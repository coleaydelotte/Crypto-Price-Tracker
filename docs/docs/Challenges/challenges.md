## 1. **Unfamiliar Technologies - Docusaurus**

One of the significant challenges faced during the development process was working with **Docusaurus**. Although Docusaurus is a powerful tool for building documentation websites, I was not very familiar with it initially, which made the learning curve steeper. Some of the challenges involved:

- **Learning the structure**: Docusaurus follows a particular structure that was different from what I was used to, so understanding its directory structure and configuration files took some time.

## 2. **Time Crunch - Only a Day to Develop**

- **Speed vs Quality**: With limited time, I had to balance speed with quality. I could not spend as much time as I would have liked to take a deep dive learning the new technology, instead I had to figure out only what I needed to stay on time. This was a very valuable experience, as I had to make sure that everything worked as expected with limited room for error.
