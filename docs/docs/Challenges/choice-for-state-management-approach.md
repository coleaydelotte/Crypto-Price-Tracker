# Why React Query?

In this project, I chose **React Query** because it simplifies the process of managing server-state, the experience I have with the state manager, and provides useful features for data fetching, caching, and synchronization. Here are the key reasons why I decided to use React Query:

## 1. **Caching**
One of the biggest advantages of React Query is its built-in **caching** system. When data is fetched, React Query automatically caches it, ensuring that subsequent requests for the same data are served from the cache instead of making redundant network calls.

- **Improved Performance**: By caching the responses, React Query significantly reduces the number of API calls, which leads to faster load times and a more efficient application.
- **Data Consistency**: Cached data can be shared across different components, ensuring that the app always uses the latest fetched data, without needing to fetch it multiple times.
- **Query and Mutation Hooks**: React Query’s hooks make it easy to fetch, create, update, and delete data with minimal boilerplate code.

## 2. **Auto-Fetching**
React Query handles **auto-fetching** of data, making it easy to automatically fetch data when a component mounts or based on certain triggers (like a refresh button).

- **Automatic Fetching**: When a component renders, React Query automatically fetches the data, reducing the need for manual `useEffect` hooks or complex state management.
- **Background Fetching**: React Query also supports background refetching to keep the data up-to-date without requiring user intervention.

## 3. **Fetching States**
React Query simplifies handling various **fetching states**, such as loading, error, and success, by providing built-in states like `isLoading`, `isFetching`, and `error`.

- **Fetching State**: It’s easy to show loading indicators when data is being fetched, improving the user experience.
- **Error Handling**: React Query provides a centralized way to handle errors, making it easy to display error messages or retry fetching if something goes wrong.
- **Success Handling**: React Query automatically updates the component when data is successfully fetched, and allows for fine-grained control over the data flow.

## Conclusion
I used **React Query** because of its powerful caching system, the seamless developer experience with its hooks and DevTools, and its ability to auto-fetch data while managing fetching states. These features allow me to easily handle data fetching and synchronization in a clean and efficient manner, without the complexity of managing server-state manually.
